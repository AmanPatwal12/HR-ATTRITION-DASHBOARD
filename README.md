## Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard
# Objective
This project aims to create a Power BI Dashboard that provides insights into employee attrition and identifies the key factors influencing turnover. The findings will help develop effective retention strategies, strengthening the workforce and improving overall employee retention.

# Dataset
The analysis uses the dataset from Kaggle titled "IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance." This dataset contains essential information on employee demographics, job attributes, performance ratings, and attrition status, which are critical for understanding the drivers of turnover.

# Steps Undertaken
Setting Objectives
Defined the project's scope and goals to uncover patterns in employee attrition.

## Data Collection and Exploration

Gathered the HR attrition dataset from Kaggle.
Conducted an exploratory analysis to examine employee demographics, job attributes, performance ratings, and attrition status, employing descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to reveal distributions, correlations, and trends.
Metric Development
Utilized Power BI Desktop and Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create key performance indicators (KPIs), including overall attrition rates and department-wise turnover metrics.

# Dashboard Creation
Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI Desktop to showcase the analysis results. The dashboard features various visualizations, filters, and slicers, enabling users to explore and understand employee attrition patterns.

Key Questions Addressed
What is the overall attrition rate, and how does it vary by gender?
Which age group experiences the highest attrition?
How does attrition differ across various departments?
Which job roles exhibit the highest attrition rates?
What is the relationship between years of service and attrition?
How does monthly salary impact attrition? Is there a correlation between low salary and high attrition?
Is there a connection between overtime work and attrition?
How do performance ratings affect attrition rates?
How does work-life balance influence attrition? Do employees leave more often when work-life balance is poor?
Conclusion
The analysis highlights critical areas for targeted interventions to enhance employee retention. By addressing factors such as work-life balance and compensation, and providing support for high-turnover roles, organizations can effectively reduce attrition rates and cultivate a more stable workforce. Implementing proactive measures based on these insights will promote a more engaged and committed workforce, ultimately contributing to long-term organizational success.
