## Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard
Objective
This project aims to create a Power BI Dashboard that offers insights into employee attrition and identifies the factors influencing turnover. The findings will help develop effective retention strategies to strengthen the workforce and improve overall employee retention.

Dataset
The analysis utilizes data from Kaggle's "IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance." This dataset contains critical information on employee demographics, job attributes, performance ratings, and attrition status, essential for understanding the drivers of turnover.

Steps Undertaken
1. Setting Objectives
Defined the project's scope and goals to gain insights into patterns of employee attrition.

2. Data Collection and Exploration
Gathered the HR attrition dataset from Kaggle.
Analyzed the dataset to examine employee demographics, job attributes, performance ratings, and attrition status using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to reveal distributions, correlations, and trends.
3. Metric Development
Utilized Power BI Desktop and Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to develop key performance indicators (KPIs), including attrition rates and department-wise turnover metrics.

4. Dashboard Creation
Created an interactive dashboard in Power BI Desktop to display the analysis results. The dashboard features various visualizations, filters, and slicers, allowing users to explore and understand employee attrition patterns.

Key Questions Addressed
What is the overall attrition rate, and how does it vary by gender?
Which age group experiences the highest attrition?
How does attrition differ across various departments?
Which job roles exhibit the highest attrition rates?
What is the relationship between years of service and attrition?
How does monthly salary impact attrition? Is there a correlation between low salary and high attrition?
Is there a connection between overtime work and attrition?
How do performance ratings affect attrition rates?
How does work-life balance influence attrition? Do employees leave more often when work-life balance is poor?
Conclusion
The analysis highlights key areas for targeted interventions to enhance employee retention. By addressing factors such as work-life balance and compensation, and by providing support for high-turnover roles, the organization can effectively reduce attrition rates and build a more stable workforce. Implementing proactive measures based on these insights will foster a more engaged and committed workforce, ultimately contributing to long-term organizational success.
